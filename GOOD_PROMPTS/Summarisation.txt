The following is a long history of an AI agent's interactions with a remote system. The agent's goal is:

{objective}

Your task is to create a concise summary of this history. The summary MUST be short but MUST preserve the most critical information, key discoveries, and the outcome of the last few steps.
The goal is to provide enough context for the AI agent to continue its task logically without the full history.
If needed, please include in the summary the exact output of the most important commands that must be used to continue the task, so the agent can use them in future commands.

Focus on:
- Initial system information discoveries (OS, hardware, etc.).
- Major actions taken (e.g., software installed, files created, configurations changed).
- Key errors encountered and their resolutions.
- If the history contains "HUMAN SEARCH" or "INTERVENTION" entries, you MUST include their findings in the summary. Do not ignore them, as they contain vital clues provided by the user.
- The final state or output from the last 2-3 commands.
